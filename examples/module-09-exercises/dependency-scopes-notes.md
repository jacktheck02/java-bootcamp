## Exercise 4


| Dependency need | Scope |
| --------------- | ----- |
| JUnit Jupiter used only in `src/test/java` | test|
| Spring Context API called from production sources (Lab 9 learning placeholder) | compile |
| JDBC driver you never import in Java source but need at runtime later | runtime|


```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
  <version>5.11.4</version>
</dependency>
```

JUnit becomes a production dependency: it is packaged/resolved for the main app, pollutes the runtime classpath, and signals the wrong intent to teammates and CI.


Test libraries always use `<scope>test</scope>`.
Do not leave JUnit on the default `compile` scope.
