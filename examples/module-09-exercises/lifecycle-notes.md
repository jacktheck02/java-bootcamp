## Exercise 3

| Intent | Command |
| ------ | ------- |
| Confirm POM parses before coding further | mvn validate|
| Compile production Java only (stops before tests if you use the phase carefully) |mvn compile|
| Run unit tests | mvn test|
| Produce `target/customer-service.jar` | mvn package|
| Run package plus verification checks CI cares about | mvn verify|
| Put the JAR into your local Maven cache | mvn install|

Continuous Integration usually runs mvn -B verify so the build is batch/non-interactive and stops after verification without casually installing or deploying from every laptop.
